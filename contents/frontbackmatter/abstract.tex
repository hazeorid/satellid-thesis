% Background
Knowledge in our perspective mostly always defined as the thinking foundation within our everyday life,
especially when we think and remember our daily knowledge.
We use mostly our own brain for storing them, then retrieve and recall that in our memory when we need them.
Knowledge management is the de facto way to help us to manage them, because our brain mostly cannot handle tons of them all quickly and safely when we partially forgot some parts of them.
It can be as simple as writing the knowledge onto a paper or book, further as complex as storing the knowledge into a software or database.
Unfortunately, there is still a lot of problems around it revolving around knowledge information, especially when we forgot a memory of knowledge.
% Purpose
The primary purpose of this study is dedicated to discuss, provide, and explain the problem and solution in managing knowledge on our daily life.
This writing build a proposed system and platform, named Satellid, for the innovative way of managing daily knowledge
such as in context of personal profiles, companies, events, and products.
Primarily for the beginning, it is focused first on solving the problem for a personal needs.
It is defined as an open knowledge manager, by using data and template approach.
Data behaves as the content of the knowledge whereas template behaves as the structure of the knowledge.
Users can use and interact with the system to browse, read, edit, add, and delete (BREAD) knowledge.
The underlying system is designed to be fast and easy.
As the initial implementation, it made as a web application.
The technologies behind it are NoSQL document database called MongoDB with its JSON universal data or file format, web technologies especially JavaScript programming language, and Node.js with a full-stack framework called Meteor.
% Result
It could managed to solve the problem and improve our process of thinking and remembering daily knowledge, and make the way of managing knowledge better.
