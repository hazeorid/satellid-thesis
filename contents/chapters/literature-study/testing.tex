\section{Software Testing}
\label{sec:software-testing}

The process of development in technical product or service requires testing to verify the function of it can do as which had been planned.
In scope of software, testing is the process of executing a program with the intent of finding errors.~\autocite{Myers:2012:Testing:6}
It is about telling the condition of the product or service that passed through a suite of test that mainly define expectation.

\subsection{Unit Testing}

Unit testing is a level of testing independently or individually.
It is written to ensure some or all of particular method can perform it task completely as expected, that carried out in the presence of the stated assertion.
The assurance is when those methods produces the expected output when given the predefined input.
In short, unit testing is regarded from the programmer's actual code perspective, more focused on internal or part functions.

\subsection{Functional Testing}

Functional testing or integration testing is mostly a level of testing lots of method that works with each other, so it checks the integration between multiple components.
The assurance is when those methods are working based on what users expecting the software system do.
In short, functional test is regarded from the user's experience perspective, more focused on events and processes that occured when the system is used.

\subsection{Automated Testing}

Automated testing of those unit testing and functional testing is possible with the help of a testing framework.
Specifically with Meteor framework, there is a testing framework package called Velocity.
Velocity wraps and supports test framework, library, and reporting (that supported in JavaScript) like Mocha, Chai, Jasmine, and much others also for \ac{TDD}, \ac{BDD}, and \ac{DDT}; making them reactive as well.
