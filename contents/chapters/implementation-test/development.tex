\subsection{Agile Development}

%TODO As known before

Also, the \ac{SDLC} of this software follows or tends to assist a software development principle called \ac{DRY}\index{don't repeat yourself},
which every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system,~\autocite{Hunt1999Pragmatic}
That means the content that potentially will be duplicated must only in a single part and be reusable.
Therefore code then resulted in a cleaner and clearer structure.
This applied as well as in test plans, the build system, and documentation within or outside the code.
Also happens in the user interaction design, therefore there is a decreased amount of duplicated data that is accidentally created or not intended by users.

JavaScript is used on the client side and Node.js is used on the server side to properly implement the designed system.

%TODO Why
JavaScript is chosen more solely because it is the language of the Web
