\subsection{Code}

JavaScript and Meteor are used on both of the sides, while Node.js is used on the server side, all coded to implement the designed system.
JavaScript is chosen more solely because it is the primary language of the Web.
Meteor is chosen because it is heavily based on JavaScript and easy to learn than any other framework out there.
