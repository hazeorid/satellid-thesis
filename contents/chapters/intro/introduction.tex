Introduction...


The development of system also follows or tends to assist a software development principle called \ac{DRY}\index{don't repeat yourself},
which every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.~\autocite{Hunt1999Pragmatic}
The code then resulted in a cleaner and clearer structure.
In detail, this applied in database schemas even we use a very flexible document database.
As well as test plans, the build system, and documentation within or outside the code.
Applied also in the user interaction design, therefore there is a decreased amount of duplicated data that is accidentally created or not intended by users.
