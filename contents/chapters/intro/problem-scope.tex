\section{Problem Scope}
\label{sec:problem-scope}

The problem we're resolving is around \ac{KM}\index{knowledge management}.
The solution we're using is create a new simpler system to do that, with Satellid knowledge manager.
The vision of Satellid could be used by everyone, both for casual and business needs.
For that, we're pushing the boundary beyond ordinary \ac{KM} that often only used inside organization.
Peculiarly, making it simple and easy to use and understand by most people.
Since an early product cannot be used by everyone, we choose for our product to be used by particular type of users.
The primary case that focused on is personal use of knowledge management, so that is the very specific coverage that will be discussed in this writing.
The prioritized personal is who regularly get and learn about any new knowledge or wanted to store their knowledge in a single system.

For the beginning, this is fine and could due to our current limit about resources and specifications.
The main features that are going to be implemented or completed first still limited around \ac{CRUD} and search operation.
Finally, Satellid's basic system should be released as an open source project and under an open source license.
