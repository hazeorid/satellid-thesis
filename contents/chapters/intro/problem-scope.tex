\section{Problem Scope}
\label{sec:problem-scope}

The problem we're resolving is around \ac{KM}\index{knowledge management}.
The solution we're using is create a new simpler system to do that, with Satellid knowledge manager.
The vision of Satellid is be used by everyone, both for casual and business needs.
For that, we're pushing the boundary beyond ordinary \ac{KM} that often only used inside organization.
Peculiarly, making it simple and easy to use and understand by most people.
Since an early product cannot be used by everyone, we choose for our product tobe used by particular type of users.
The primary case we focus on is how colleagues in a startup work environment share their knowledge together. That's it, the first kind of users of this solution are startup founders and employees within their organization.
For the beginning, this is fine and could overcome our current limit about resources and specifications.
The main features that are going to be implemented or completed first still limited around \ac{CRUD} and search operation.
