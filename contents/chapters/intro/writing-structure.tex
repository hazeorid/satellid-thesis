\section{Writing Structure}
\label{sec:writing-structure}

The writing structure of this thesis is divided into five chapters:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Introduction: background, research, problem
\item Theory: knowledge, database, programming
\item Analysis \& design: logic, design
\item Implementation: development process
\item Closing: conclusion, suggestion
\end{enumerate}

First is introduction about what we're going to build based on background, assisted with research method, then scope or limit the problem we want to solve.
Then in the theoritical study, we describe each of the supporting knowledge materials.
Those are knowledge management system, how it compare with other definition, database and system, \ac{DBMS}, \ac{NoSQL} database and its document variant.
The programming language we're covering is JavaScript with its JSON data format and Node.js platform, also a full stack framework called Meteor.
The analysis is about logical reason and persona of users, while design is about interaction and interface.
The implementation is about development process and application result.
Finally the closing is telling conlclusion and suggestion about the research up to result.
