\section{Logic}
\label{sec:logic}

The logic mainline is compiled up from the ``Key Reason'' and ``Logic Persona''.
Key reason is the cause that make running the implementation worth attempted.

\subsection{Key Reason}

The main key reason to build the implementation is to

\subsection{User Types}

Using rapid and micro approach to do knowledge management should enable features corresponds to each user types or user stories that listed here:

\begin{easylist}[itemize]
  & As a person, I don't need to manually shout a new knowledge, so others can rapidly know what's the latest info then I can continue to do my study or work.
  & As a new user, I need to quickly use and understand the workflow, so I can immediately store my knowledge.
  & As a colleague of other user, I need to quickly know what other user have know, so I can learn from them.
  & As a student, I need to store and manage and find my knowledge easily, so I can neatly organize a preparation for study, exam, or portfolio.
  & As a teacher, I need to share my knowledge faster and effectively throughout the class or workshop, so I can focus on teaching and involving students to do the actual work precisely.
  & As a speaker, I need to liberate and outsource the presentation and discussion, so I with the audience can get the collaboration to live.
  & As a collaborator, I need to have the prerequisites to have, so I can work together at the same pace and level.
  & As the leader of some users in a team, I need to collect all their knowledge, so I can smarten and explain the knowledge.
  & As a recruiter of a new employee, I need to have the recruitees' knowledge in a consise and portable format, so I can compare and select who's the right candidate.
  & As a boss, I need to know what my employees are up to automatically, so I don't need to ask them rigorously.
  & As an engineer, I need to quickly construct a basic system based on my prior knowledge, so I know which are the most required and important elements.
  & As an information architect, I need to quickly architect the main partial of all information available that required, so I can structure the information within working environments.
  & As a developer, I need to be able to create a plugin or extension, so I can add more functionality to the system/platform.
  & As a designer, I need to be able to create a custom theme, so I can customize the appearance based on my style and taste.
  & As a researcher, I need to be able collect various data and research information related to my current knowledge and purpose, so I can quickly connect and filter them to be used within my experiments.
\end{easylist}

Event not mentioned explicitly again within those user types, the shape of knowledge management will normally always be the same, to make sure those knowledge are easily managed and neatly organized across different people.
