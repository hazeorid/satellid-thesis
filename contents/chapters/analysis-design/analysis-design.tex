\chapter{Analysis \& Design}
\label{chap:analysis-design}

In this chapter we're first analyze and design to implement the basic Satellid system as fast as possible.
There is a need to pass through a simple effective implementation method.
The required phases in the method are simply:

\begin{easylist}
& Analyzing solution to define logic and algorithm
& Designing basic interaction and interface
\end{easylist}
