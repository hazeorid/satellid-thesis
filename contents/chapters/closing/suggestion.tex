\section{Suggestion}
\label{sec:suggestion}

It has been realized since the beginning that no system that could cover or solve a problem perfectly without any mistake.
But at least this work is going towards it, seek to do improvement.
Error and failures can always show up and should be be solved and worked out.
We realize there are much handful of sides on Satellid that must be improved and fixed.
Indeed, we need to always improve both system and implementation over time, along with agile moves based on users need and advancement of technology.
That's why, we're releasing it as an open source project.
So users or other developers can customize it and patch for custom or more features.
Therefore, if community or other researcher find it interesting and helpful, partially they can help and contribute.
Either contribution for the system or content perspective.
That's also for their own benefit when the result is getting better.
The data, information, and knowledge that involved in this writing are basically open for anyone to freely use, update/modify, and share.

So there is a roadmap and upcoming features or abilities that Satellid need or nice to have:

\begin{easylist}
& Account system, regular and admin users, including support for multiple person even up to organization.
& Import and export existing knowledge, inside and outside of the system.
& More predefined context and field.
& Create, edit, and delete a template.
& Change the defined context of the knowledge.
& Image, audio, and video support.
& Transform location into maps.
& Data visualization and reporting.
& More options and configurations to customize.
& Integration with other networks such as Google+, Facebook, Twitter, etc.
& Browser extension (Google Chrome) or plugin (Mozilla Firefox).
& Using \ac{JSON-LD} as the base data format.
& Data encryption with bcrypt.
& End to end encryption with OpenPGP.
\end{easylist}
