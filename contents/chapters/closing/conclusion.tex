\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclustion}

It has been realized since the beginning that no system that could cover anything perfectly.
But at least we're going towards it, seek to do improvement.
Error and failures can always show up to be solved and worked out.
Especially when there is a causal failure of improper planning, design, coordination, evaluation and resultant failure of lack of relevance, quality, usability, responsibility, ownership also improper implementation of technology.~\autocite{Frost2014Synthesis}
We realize there are much handful of sides on Satellid that must be improved and fixed.
Indeed, we need to always improve both system and implementation over time, along with agile moves based on users need and advancement of technology.
That's why, we're releasing it as an open source product.
Therefore, if community or other researcher find it interesting and helpful, partially they can help and contribute.
That's also for their own benefit when the result is getting better.
