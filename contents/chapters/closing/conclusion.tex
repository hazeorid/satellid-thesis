Managing tons of knowledge is possible with a simple system and user interface of knowledge manager.
The formula is using data and template approach to classify the knowledge context.
So if there are tons of knowledge that can be classified with context, user can easily manage them.
Also, this isn't to replace any existing system that not related to knowledge management.
If the person need to have a project management or free form notes, they need to use other than Satellid.

Knowledge manager can adapt to daily knowledge context because there is data schema that is very flexible enough to be modified over times.
\ac{NoSQL} database that utilize document-based (specifically \ac{JSON}) data store is one of the best schema-less data model, that simple enough to use and fit the requirement.
With it, over changing data field can be added, updated, removed corresponds on contents of the knowledge.
After that, there is a need to give every piece of knowledge a context, the meaning of it.

Knowledge manager can naturally stucture the data if user is provided with a prebuilt template based on their contextual needs.

Implementing a knowledge manager with web technologies can be done easily now with the help of a full stack framework called Meteor.
The main building components of those technologies in Meteor are JavaScript, JSON, Node.js, and MongoDB.
